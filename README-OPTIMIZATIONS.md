# Arbor Partner Portal - Performance Optimizations

## Optimization Checklist

This document tracks the performance optimizations implemented in the Arbor Partner Portal web application to ensure fast page load times.

### Completed Optimizations

- [x] **Code Splitting with React.lazy and Suspense**
  - Implemented in `App.tsx` to reduce initial bundle size
  - Components are now loaded only when needed, improving initial load time
  - Added SuspenseWrapper component to handle loading states consistently

- [x] **Extracted Data Fetching Logic into Custom Hooks**
  - Created `useAdminDashboardData.ts` to separate data fetching from UI rendering
  - Created `usePartnerDashboardData.ts` for partner dashboard data management
  - Improved component rendering performance and code maintainability

- [x] **Optimized Build Configuration**
  - Enhanced `vite.config.ts` with improved chunk splitting strategy
  - Enabled minification for JavaScript and CSS
  - Added cache busting for assets with content hashing
  - Optimized dependency handling during build

- [x] **Component Memoization**
  - Created `MemoizedDashboardGrid.tsx` with React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders
  - Memoized child components to optimize rendering performance

- [x] **Implemented Pagination for Large Data Tables**
  - Added pagination to `PartnerShops.tsx` to improve rendering performance
  - Only renders a subset of data at a time, reducing DOM size

### Remaining Optimizations

- [ ] **Image Optimization**
  - Compress images in the public directory (arbor-logo.png, tempo.jpg)
  - Convert images to modern formats like WebP where appropriate

- [ ] **Browser Caching Configuration**
  - Configure appropriate cache headers for static assets

- [ ] **Third-party Library Review**
  - Analyze and optimize usage of third-party libraries
  - Remove any unused or unnecessary dependencies

## Performance Impact

### Bundle Size Reduction
- Initial JavaScript bundle size reduced by implementing code splitting
- Better chunk distribution with more granular manual chunks

### Rendering Performance
- Improved component rendering with memoization techniques
- Reduced unnecessary re-renders in dashboard components
- Implemented pagination for large data sets to improve rendering performance

### Data Fetching Optimization
- Extracted data fetching logic into custom hooks for better separation of concerns
- Improved caching and state management for dashboard data

## Next Steps

To further improve performance:

1. Implement the remaining optimizations from the checklist
2. Consider implementing server-side rendering for critical pages
3. Add performance monitoring to track metrics over time
4. Implement progressive loading for large data sets
5. Add service worker for offline capabilities and caching
